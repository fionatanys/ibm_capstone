This study is to understand what contributes to the success of the landing of the first stage of Falcon 9 rockets.
Data was collected from SpaceX API and webscraping. Data was processed to remove null values and unnecessary features. Exploratory data analysis was performed to observe pattern in data using visualization, SQL queries, interactive dashboard and folium map. Finally, predictive classification models was built, and evaluation performed to select the best model.
The success rate of landing increases over the year as technology improves. Lighter payload mass generally has higher success rate. 
The best predictive classification model for this study is the decision tree model.
